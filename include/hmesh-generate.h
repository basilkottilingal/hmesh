## **ðŸ”¹ Comparison of Algorithm**
| **Algorithm** | **Best for** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|--------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Delaunay** | Unstructured grids, FEA | Guarantees well-shaped triangles | May require post-processing |
| **Marching Cubes** | Implicit surfaces (MRI, CT) | Works well with volume data | Can create non-manifold geometry |
| **Poisson** | Point cloud smoothing | Produces smooth, natural surfaces | Needs high-quality input |
| **Voronoi-Based** | CFD, isotropic meshing | Good element quality | Computationally expensive |
| **Advancing Front** | FEA, structured grids | High-quality, structured meshes | Complex implementation |
