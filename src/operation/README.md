# Converting Expression

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. JUST EVALUATING PLAUSIBILITY.

?? How to handle general expression like
$$ Ax + b = c $$

## Requirement
  * Handle derivatives, other differential operators
  * Tensor operations including 0th, 1st, and 2nd order tensors.
  * Extend for differential geometry. (Discrete Exterior Calculus)
  * Can you apply for objective minimisation problems like linear solvers (x = A^(-1)  c - b), using along with or in place of multigrid solvers
  * Optimise for GPU
